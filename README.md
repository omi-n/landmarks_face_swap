# Face Swapping Using Meshes
To use this project, you will need the latest version of pip and
some fairly up-to-date python version. I have personally
tested this application using python 3.10, but 3.8 and above should
work fine.


## Instructions
1. Install all dependencies with: `pip -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the application with `python hollistic.py <image_to_swap_with>`

## Common Issues
If the system is saying that python or pip are not commands,
type in `pip3` in place of `pip` and `python3` in place of `python`.
